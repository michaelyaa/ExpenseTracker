# Expense Tracker

It is a form that allows the user to enter a title for a purchase, a price, a date, and a place of purchase.

I am developing the app as I am learning React.js and connecting the knowledge whole.

I am also learning how to implement a chart that shows the statistics of the user's spending based on what the user entered.
